TreeBuilder
===========

Simple Tree-Builder for PHP

Add items in form of an array or an object. Just define the parent- and the child-attributes and let the script handle the rest.

Suppors array and objects using getter and setter.

You may define a value for sorting the items inside the tree.

The demo contains additional scripts, as the marku, some CSS and a jQuery plugin to control the tree, using HTML5 storage to remember which branch was opened.

The working demo can be found here: http://git.squareflower.de/treebuilder/demo/
